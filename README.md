# LyriQ

A simple MVP app inspired by the Genius.com Android app that lets users create custom lyric cards.

Live App : [lyriq@netlify](https://lyriqs.netlify.app/)


## Why Create This When Genius.com Already Exist?

You can't create lyric cards on genius.com web — only on the Android app.
Not every song has lyrics available on Genius.
Sometimes you just remember a line, know the song name, and want a clean lyric card to post.

This app lets you create your own.

## How Image Export Works

LyriQ uses the `html-to-image` library to generate lyric cards.

The library converts a DOM node (a specific `<div>` containing the lyric card) into an image by serializing it and converting it into a Base64-encoded data URL.

### Important Implementation Detail

Initially, the app used a Blob URL when a user uploaded an image. However, `html-to-image` could not properly render Blob URLs during export in this setup.

To fix this:

* The uploaded file is read using the **FileReader API**
* The file is converted into a **Base64 data URL**
* That Base64 string is used as the image source
* This allows `html-to-image` to correctly capture the full div (including the background image) during export

Without converting the Blob to Base64, the background image would not appear in the generated lyric card.
